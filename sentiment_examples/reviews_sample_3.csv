positive	miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .

negative	high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
positive	each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
positive	there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
negative	the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen . 
positive	i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s .
