positive	watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it . 
positive	somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
positive	[washington's] strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene . 
positive	the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety . 
positive	instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
negative	a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
negative	to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
negative	diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
positive	happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
positive	sex is one of those films that aims to confuse . 
positive	austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride . 
positive	bouquet gives a performance that is masterly . 
positive	i was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon . 
negative	a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
positive	as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
negative	this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
positive	those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . 
positive	cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement . 
positive	this is a very fine movie -- go see it . 
negative	one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 
negative	as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
positive	 " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
positive	an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion . 
positive	in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
positive	the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
positive	nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects . 
negative	many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
negative	the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
positive	the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
negative	the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
positive	 . . . creates a visceral sense of its characters' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above . . . what could have been a melodramatic , lifetime channel-style anthology . 
positive	anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . 
negative	feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 
negative	a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
positive	one of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre . 
negative	it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
negative	a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
positive	a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages . 
positive	i loved the look of this film . 
positive	seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but . 
positive	jirí hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 
positive	a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
negative	an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
positive	as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
positive	an utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question . 
positive	this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
positive	enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers . 
positive	hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy . 
negative	about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
positive	crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy . 
negative	serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
negative	try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
negative	given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
negative	a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
negative	rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
negative	a negligible british comedy . 
positive	as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
negative	it tells more than it shows . 
positive	the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill . 
positive	parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into buñuel's casings
negative	despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
negative	the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
positive	 i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . 
positive	 . . . a guiltless film for nice evening out . 
negative	a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
negative	maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
positive	solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining . 
negative	suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
positive	rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual . 
negative	strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
negative	this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
positive	there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness . 
positive	it may not be history – but then again , what if it is ? – but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
positive	it's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything . 
negative	imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
negative	this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
negative	the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
positive	it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . . 
negative	it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
negative	in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
negative	you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
negative	 " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor…it's just plain bored . 
positive	while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 
negative	simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
negative	schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
negative	the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
negative	it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
negative	 . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
negative	everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
positive	all the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost . 
positive	has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title . 
negative	the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
positive	a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview . 
positive	at just over an hour , home movie will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face . 
negative	aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
negative	the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
positive	between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results . 
negative	for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
positive	cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone . 
positive	an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves .
