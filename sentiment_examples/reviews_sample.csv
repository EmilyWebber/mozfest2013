positive	originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller . 
positive	an absorbing and unsettling psychological drama . 
positive	high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
negative	a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience . 
positive	the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency . 
negative	yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence . 
positive	writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 
positive	sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film . 
positive	to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
negative	the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
negative	imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
negative	mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
negative	has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
positive	may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
negative	the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
negative	it treats women like idiots . 
positive	it's a very valuable film . . . 
negative	every note rings false . 
positive	a tour de force of modern cinema . 
negative	a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
positive	this is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party . 
positive	a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . 
positive	it may not be history – but then again , what if it is ? – but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
positive	george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 
positive	got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . . 
positive	the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze . 
positive	it's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . 
negative	 . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
positive	most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds . 
positive	the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
negative	the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
negative	theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
positive	sweetly sexy , funny and touching . 
negative	 . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . 
negative	a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
positive	exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
negative	circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
positive	land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored . 
positive	the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself . 
negative	sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
negative	van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
positive	huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty . 
positive	don't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life . 
negative	there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
negative	statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
positive	miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images . 
positive	if you're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film . 
positive	does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 
positive	filmmakers dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann area headed east , far east , in retelling a historically significant , and personal , episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens of thousands of german jewish refugees while the world's democracie
positive	this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath . 
negative	an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
negative	an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson . 
positive	it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
positive	each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs . man as brother-man vs . the man . 
positive	a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
positive	altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
negative	fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
negative	as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
negative	it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
negative	blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . 
positive	a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad . 
negative	[sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
negative	i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
negative	at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
negative	each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
negative	although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
negative	even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
negative	there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
negative	choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
negative	an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
positive	the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
negative	too silly to take seriously . 
positive	a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
positive	about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come . 
positive	the performances are remarkable . 
positive	can i admit xxx is as deep as a petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ? 
negative	there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
negative	a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
negative	while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
negative	whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
negative	to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
negative	it bites hard . 
negative	mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
positive	one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind . 
negative	van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
positive	what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey . 
positive	flawed but worthy look at life in u . s . relocation camps . 
negative	i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
negative	it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
negative	i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
positive	that it'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture
negative	an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
positive	the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
positive	this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance . 
positive	an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
positive	a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 
negative	the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
negative	scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
positive	the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen . 
negative	apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
