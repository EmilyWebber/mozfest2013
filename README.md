How to deal with text as data
===========
Prepared for the Mozilla Festival 2013

## Overview

This repository contains a presentation, starter code, and example data.  The presentation can be found in `mozfest-2013-slides`.

Starter code is in both `R` and `Python`, but this repository (currently) doesn't contain all of the dependencies.  This is due to worries about wifi availability in the venue.  Links to required dependencies will be added soon.

Starter code is in `.Rmd` and in `.ipynb` formats, meaning that you will require a way of opening R Markdown files and IPython notebooks.  The following links may be helpful:

- RStudio (for R): http://www.rstudio.com/
- Canopy (for Python): https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/free/
-- also includes many useful Python dependencies
- IPython: http://ipython.org/install.html
