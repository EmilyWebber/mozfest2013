      "We're going to take advantage of a library that comes with a pretrained model, [SASA](https://code.google.com/p/sasa-tool/).  This is produced by the University of Southern California.  It's a perfectly suitable Naive Bayes classifier, but it is rather slow.  I don't recommend it for large datasets (read: millions of sentences) unless you are prepared to do some distributed processing.\n",

This consists of thousands of processed sentences/snippets of movie reviews from the Rotten Tomatoes website."
